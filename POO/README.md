# Java
Here you'll find different projects around Java. </br>

Please note that I'm studying Java, the programs won't be super efficient and perfect (as well as beautifully constructed). I'll correct them as I get better with java. </br> 

What's available:
- Jukebox: a little CD player that can play 5 different CD in a player
- Tamagotchi: a little program that creates an object, a Tamagotchi, with a name, and the user can feed it maximum 3 times before sending it to sleep
